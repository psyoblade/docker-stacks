Hi! Thanks for using the Jupyter Docker Stacks.

Please see the [Suggesting a new feature](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/features.html#suggesting-a-new-feature) section in the documentation for our preferred processes.

**What docker images this feature is applicable to?**

Example: `jupyter/scipy-notebook`

**What changes do you propose?**

Example: Add a package [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io).

**How does this change will affect users?**

Example: Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python, based on Vega and Vega-Lite, and the source is available on GitHub.
With Altair, you can spend more time understanding your data and its meaning.
Altairâ€™s API is simple, friendly and consistent and built on top of the powerful Vega-Lite visualization grammar.
This elegant simplicity produces beautiful and effective visualizations with a minimal amount of code.
